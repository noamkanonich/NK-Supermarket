3.2) The difficult part in this ex, was definitely the part of the server.js (backend) and the scripts of - shoppinglist.js, amounts.js and contactus.js. <br>
At first, it was difficult for me to unsderstand perfectly how to connect between all the function and fetch in the js files, but with some help from the web<br>
and some friend, I succeed to understand it.

<br>
<br>

4)	The fun part in this ex was definitely the part of designing the application.  When the application was fully completed, I felt satisfaction,<br>
and that was very fun for me.
